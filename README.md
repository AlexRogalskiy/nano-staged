# Nano Staged

Tool to run commands only on git staged files, **speeding up the validation/formatting** processes. It is for working with **git hooks** tools like an [simple-git-hooks](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks) and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

- ðŸ“¦ **Small**: 200x+ lighter than **lint-staged**.
- ðŸ¥‡ **Single dependency** ([`picocolors`](https://github.com/alexeyraspopov/picocolors)).

The performance results were generated on a MBP Late 2013, 2,3 GHz Intel Core i7 by running `npm run benchmark` in the library folder. See [benchmarks/running-time/index.js](https://github.com/usmanyunusov/nano-staged/blob/master/benchmarks/running-time/index.js)

## Usage

1. Install `nano-staged` as a dev dependency:

   ```terminal
   npm install --save-dev nano-staged
   ```

2. Add the `nano-staged` section to your `package.json`. Fill it with glob pattern and the corresponding commands.

   For example:

   ```json
   "nano-staged": {
     "*.js": "prettier --write",
     "*.css": ["stylelint", "eslint --fix"]
   },
   ```

3. Run `./node_modules/.bin/nano-staged` to run commands.

4. Add the `simple-git-hooks` section to your `package.json` and fill in the `pre-commit` for the `npx nano-staged`.

   For example:

   ```json
   "simple-git-hooks": {
     "pre-commit": "./node_modules/.bin/nano-staged"
   }
   ```

5. Run the CLI script to update the git hooks with the commands from the config.

   ```terminal
   npx simple-git-hooks
   ```
