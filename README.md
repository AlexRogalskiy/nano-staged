# Nano Staged

Tool to run commands only on git staged files, **speeding up the validation/formatting** processes. It is for working with **git hooks** tools like an [simple-git-hooks](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks) and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

- üì¶ **Small**: ?x+ lighter than **lint-staged**.
- ü•á **Single dependency** (Picocolors).
- ü§ù **Without merge conflicts**

## Benchmarks

```diff
$ node benchmarks/running-time/index.js
Running time for 1 files
- lint-staged 1.602 ms
+ nano-staged 1.219 ms
```

```diff
$ node benchmarks/running-time/index.js
Running time for 3 files
- lint-staged 2.277 ms
+ nano-staged 1.905 ms
```

The performance results were generated on a MBP Late 2013, 2,3 GHz Intel Core i7 by running `npm run benchmark` in the library folder. See [benchmarks/running-time/index.js](https://github.com/usmanyunusov/nano-staged/blob/master/benchmarks/running-time/index.js)
